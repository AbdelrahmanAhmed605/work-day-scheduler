# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Website displaying a simple work-day scheduler application which allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The application constantly keeps track of the current time and displays it on the screen, while styling time slots depending on their relation to the current time (past, present, or future). By saving event information to the local storage, the user can always return to the webpage to find their last saved event information. A note is also displayed to the user confirming when an event has been successfully saved. The webpage features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

During the project, Abdelrahman learnt the following skills:
- how to use JQuery selectors to find and manipulate HTML elements
- how to traverse through the DOM using JQuery methods (ex: .parents(), .siblings))
- how to add and remove elements and classes using JQuery
- how to use Javascript libraries and their online documentation to correctly apply their methods

## Installation
N/A

## Usage

The link to the website can be found here: https://abdelrahmanahmed605.github.io/work-day-scheduler/ . A video illustrating the use of the webpage can be found below.

To use the work-day planner website, you can click on a text area to edit its information. The selected text area will be highlighted to better illustrate where the user is editing. Once a user has typed in the event information to the text area, they can click on its respective save button to save the new information into the local storage. The page will automatically scroll to the top, where the user is presented with a message confirming that their recent event addition has been saved. The current time is displayed at the top of the page and stylings are applied to the elements on the page to visually display which time slots are in the past, present, and future.
